## ⚙️ SYSTEM BLUEPRINT

This document outlines the core technical standards and guiding principles for any project adopted under this documentation framework.

## 1. Core Principles

This section houses fundamental philosophies that guide technical decisions across all projects, regardless of the specific tools used.

## 2. Technology & Tooling

This section defines the standard technologies and tools that should be used to ensure consistency and interoperability.

### 2.1. Containerization: Docker

* **Policy**: All tools, services, and development environments must be containerized using Docker. Docker Compose should be used for orchestration when multiple services are involved.
* **Reasoning**:
  * **Standardization**: Ensures a consistent and isolated development environment.
  * **Reproducibility**: Makes development and production environments highly reproducible.
  * **Simplicity**: Simplifies onboarding by reducing complex setup procedures to a few Docker commands.
