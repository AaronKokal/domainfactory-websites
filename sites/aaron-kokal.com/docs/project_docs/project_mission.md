# Mission

Publish an extremely simple, fast, and privacy‑respecting static website at `aaron-kokal.com`, and use the domain to host a few utility subdomains such as a standing meeting room at `meet.aaron-kokal.com`.

Key principles:
- Minimal surface area: plain HTML/CSS; no client JS unless necessary.
- Fast and durable: deploy as static files; versioned via Git.
- Privacy first: no trackers; optional privacy‑friendly analytics later.
- Own the domain and DNS; use subdomains for simple utilities.
